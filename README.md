# CentOS QA harness ansible scripts

Those scripts are used by Jenkins within the CentOS QA dedicated environment (behind https://console.qa.centos.org) to deploy nodes and then launch some functional test (see other git repository for t_functional)

Here are the type of nodes that are deployed :

* Bare Metal (IBM HS21 blades)
* KVM guests
* Xen guests (Paravirt)
* VirtualBox guests
* Vmware ESXi guests
